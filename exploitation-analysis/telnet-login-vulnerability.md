# Telnet Login Vulnerability – Case Study

## Overview
This case study documents the identification and analysis of an insecure
Telnet service discovered during network reconnaissance in a controlled
lab environment.

The objective was to assess the security risk posed by legacy services
using plaintext authentication mechanisms.

## Environment
- Target type: Lab / intentionally vulnerable system
- Network type: Isolated test environment
- Operating system: Linux (Metasploitable-style target)

## Methodology
The assessment followed a structured approach:
1. Network reconnaissance and service discovery
2. Identification of exposed services
3. Authentication weakness analysis
4. Risk evaluation and impact assessment

## Key Findings
- Telnet service (TCP port 23) was exposed to the network
- Authentication was performed in plaintext
- Weak credentials allowed unauthorized access
- Lack of access controls increased attack surface

## Risk Analysis
An exposed Telnet service introduces the following risks:
- Credential interception via network sniffing
- Unauthorized remote access
- Potential lateral movement
- Compliance and security policy violations

Overall Risk Rating: **High**

## Recommendations
- Disable Telnet service entirely
- Replace Telnet with SSH using key-based authentication
- Restrict remote access using firewall rules
- Enforce strong authentication policies
- Monitor for unauthorized login attempts

## Conclusion
This assessment highlights the continued risk posed by legacy services
in modern environments. Removing insecure protocols and enforcing
secure remote access mechanisms significantly reduces attack surface.

educational and defensive security purposes only.
