# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Subhendu Senapati

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity analysis projects focused on
network traffic analysis, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and
attack technique evaluation.

The work here reflects how I approach security problems:
- Observe and collect evidence
- Analyze findings from a defender’s perspective
- Explain risk clearly
- Recommend practical remediation

## Focus Areas
- Network Traffic & Packet Analysis (Wireshark)
- Reconnaissance & Service Exposure Analysis (Nmap, DNS, OSINT)
- Vulnerability Assessment & Misconfiguration Analysis
- Social Engineering & Human-Factor Security

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite
- Kali Linux, Linux, Windows
- TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS

## How to Navigate
Each folder represents a specific security domain.
Inside each folder, you will find structured case studies and reports
documenting objectives, methodology, findings, risk analysis, and remediation.

> Note: All activities were performed in lab or authorized test environments.
No production systems were harmed.
